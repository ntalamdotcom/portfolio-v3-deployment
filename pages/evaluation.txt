Certainly, let's start by evaluating the six most important professional skills often considered crucial in the workplace:

1. Communication Skills
2. Technical Proficiency
3. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
4. Teamwork and Collaboration
5. Leadership Skills
6. Time Management and Organization

I'll ask a series of questions for each category. Please provide detailed answers to help me better assess your skills.

### Communication Skills
1. How do you handle misunderstandings with colleagues? Can you share an example?

If there was a misunderstanding with a colleague, first I would start giving context about the situation. Then I would ask for my colleagues version and listening carefully. 
After listening, I would tell him / her what is happening or happened after the misunderstanding, and how that affected me, people and or companies. 

2. How do you explain complex technical concepts to non-technical team members or clients?
I would lower the level of detail, and find a way to explain the concepts using analogous concepts. A classic example would be how a PC works in terms of processors, hard disks, and ram.
The computer is someone working on a desk. The processor speed could be compared to how fast is the person working on a desk. The ram could be the same as how big is the surface of the desk, 
when putting the documents on. the hard-disk is the same as the cabinet where the documents folders are stored. 
If there is not enough ram we need to open and save the documents every time we use them, because we can not work with on a small desk with too many documents.  

### Technical Proficiency
3. What is the most complex project you have worked on? What technologies did you use?
Working for Termatrac, I have created an instance of EC2 to run a NextJS project. the database was an AWS Aurora Postgres database, accessed by an AWS API Gateway.
The credentials were controled by AWS Cognito. The front end of the project was React.

4. Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new technology or tool on the job?
I have learnt new tools and technologies all the time. When working for QIS packaging, I learnt Microsoft Power BI.
When worked for Termatrac, many AWS services. Working for GeoAire, I learned JSF, Primefaces, Linux, and others.

### Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
5. Describe a challenging problem you've faced at work and the steps you took to resolve it.
when working for GeoAire, I was asked how to show points in a map on the web application. 
I evaluated many OpenSource software and services. The problem with open source software is most of the time there is no immediate support.
The openmap feature required too much disk space to save the prerendering tiles or runtime cost to render it in real time.
At the end, after trying many different open source software solutions we found that Google maps has a threshold of requests per day (1000). 
Which it was by far above the usage of the web application.

6. How do you approach making difficult decisions when there are multiple stakeholders involved?
I request a reasonable time for research. Usually a week or two if it is something parallel to the daily tasks.
After that, I request a meeting to inform the pros and cons of each current option. 
If the current options are not acceptable, I ask for more time, to explore more options or delegate the request to another colleague or externalize it.

### Teamwork and Collaboration
7. Can you share an experience where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member?
I had a problem with a team member that was not working with enough dedication. I talked first to him about the problem and waited for his reaction.
He improved for a few months, but after that his performance was bad again. I had to escalate the problem to the team leader.
Sadly he was fired, for repeating the same cycle of good and then bad performance again.

8. How do you contribute to a team project to ensure its success?
Finish my tasks first. If there is a problem in the team, solve it first. 
If there is someone late, dedicate a reasonable amount of time to help that person.
Unexpected emergencies such as sickness or accidents are everyone problem and we must put extra effort.
Miscalculation from the team leader is acceptable as long as it is not something that happens often, and the team needs to be empathic.
Having leisure time as a team is also mandatory for the synergy.

### Leadership Skills
9. Have you ever had to take the lead on a project? What were the results?
Yes, the team did its best and we produce properly.
Sadly the sales team promised too much and we lost clients. 

10. How do you handle conflict within your team?
listening to each member of the team first, asking for their versions, one by one. Get a conclusion and request a meeting to solve the conflict between the people involved.
If the meeting was not enough, offer more time for cooling down bad thoughts, and request another meeting.
If the problem persist and there is no solution, make drastic decisions.

### Time Management and Organization
11. How do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple projects to handle?
Evaluate the impact of finishing, canceling or postponing each project, and possible scenarios.
What is the impact of talking to the stakeholders about the impact of the decisions. Will they approve the decisions or the reputation of the team/company/leaders will be affected by these meetings.
Considering the economic impact of the decisions.

12. Describe a situation where you had to meet tight deadlines. How did you ensure timely completion?
If the projects reward worthed the extra effort, I used my free time.
There was a project requesting a customer counting system when the customers entering the stores. 
I bought a few cameras and payed extra for the blackbox software instead of making it myself.
I saved time, but the system sample cost me extra money. As a pilot project.
I sacrificed the customized source code for having a fully integrated system already. 
However, they wanted the source code more than the service itself, and the project was cancelled.

Please answer these questions, and based on your responses, I'll provide an evaluation.
